                <h2>Life Without Limbs</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Nicholas James Vujicic</b> born 4 December 1982 is an Australian
                    American Christian evangelist and motivational speaker of Serbian descent, born with tetra-amelia
                    syndrome, a rare disorder characterised by the absence of arms and legs.
                    Vujicic was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1982 to Dušanka and Borislav Vujičić, Serbian
                    immigrants from Yugoslavia.

                    He was born without fully formed limbs and he was bullied at school because of it. At one point, he
                    tried killing himself by drowning in his bathtub but he was saved and it didn't continue. According
                    to his autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him when the nurse held him in front of
                    her, and she and her husband went out of the hospital.

                    When he was seventeen years old, Vujicic's mother showed him a newspaper article about a woman
                    praying with a severe disability; he then started to give talks at his prayer group.Vujicic
                    graduated from Griffith University at the age of 21 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, with a
                    double major in accountancy and financial planning.
